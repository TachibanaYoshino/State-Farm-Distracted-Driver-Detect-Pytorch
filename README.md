# State-Farm-Distracted-Driver-Detect-Pytorch
This project is from a kaggle competition in 2016, we use mobileNet V2 to achieve classification recognition based on pytorch.

# 1„ÄÅBrief  
The implementation of the [State Farm Distracted Driver Detection] competition in kaggle.  
  
Classify a picture of driver behavior, a total of 10 categories  
The 10 classes to predict are:  


c0: safe driving  
c1: texting - right  
c2: talking on the phone - right  
c3: texting - left

c5: operating the radio  
c6: drinking  
c7: reaching behind
